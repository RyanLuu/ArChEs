## Description

In this project, we leverage the [Microsoft PROSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/prose-framework/) program synthesis-by-example framework to solve generic problems 
taken from the [Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC), which is directly related to the [Abstraction & Reasoning Challenge hosted on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge). 
The ARC contains a set of task examples meant to measure the ability of an agent 
to synthesize correct programs for generic, image-based problems that are not amenable to current learning techniques.
